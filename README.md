# lovoccs_pipe
A pipeline for processing DECam data taken by the Local Volume Complete Cluster Survey (LoVoCCS)

This pipeline is built to walk the user through specific "processing steps" to go from raw images of galaxy clusters stored on the [NOIRLab Science Archive](https://astroarchive.noirlab.edu/) to lensing science. Going from raw data to coadds is carried out via a user's installation of the [LSST Science Pipelines](https://pipelines.lsst.io/) (LSP) and going from coadds/catalogs to lensing products is carried out through our own 'homebrewed' scripts. This build is compatible with LSP `v26_0_0` and relies on a modified version of the DECam Data Release Pipeline: `DRP-LoVoCCS.yaml`.

To get started with processing, from the directory you want to process in, clone this repository then create a new directory for processing a cluster (e.g. processing A85, clone the repo and define a new folder so that `.../A85/` and `.../lovoccs_pipe/` are in the same directory). Update the configs located in `python_scripts/configs/...` so that your filepaths are correct. Then, copy `run_steps_gen3.sh` into the new cluster directory (`.../A85/`), update the filepath-variables at the top of the script, and run each step by uncommenting their corresponding command, starting with line 1147, `create_output`.
